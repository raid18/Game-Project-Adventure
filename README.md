In outline form, the operation of a simple game of this type looks like this:

Initialize variables to store the world map and current state of the game
Display information about the player's location
Determine whether the game is supposed to end right now (e.g. win or loss); if so, print a message and exit
Wait for the user to enter a command (e.g. "north")
Modify the game state to reflect the action indicated by the user command (e.g. change location). If the game rules prohibit the user from performing the requested action, print a message to that effect.
Return to step 2
